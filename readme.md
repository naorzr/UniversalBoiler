<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction

Creating the first setup for your project is daunting, much of the time, you'd either search for a     
pre-made boilerplate on github, that is usually never a tailor fit for your needs(and mostly outdated)   
or go about a journey to make it yourself.(for the hundred time)

Universal-Boilerplate has three main goals!
1. Construct a boilerplate that's tailor made for your needs, with all the tooling and jazz.
2. Make it super easy for community contributions to be added.
3. Be un-opinionated, un-restricting as much as possible, unlike awesome projects like next.js, we don't manage stuff for you.   
We merely create the boilerplate and from there on, you're on your own. (for better and worse).


### Prerequisites

You should have Node v12.13 and above, and npx installed on your machine.

## Usage

```
npx universal-boiler
```
